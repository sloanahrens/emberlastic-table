### qbox.io pageable table demo

- This demo uses a [qbox.io](http://qbox.io) search index populated with a million records.
- Pagination, sorting and searching are all performed server-side by [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org).
- The UI is constructed with [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) and [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap).
- Some of the code was adapted from this [project](https://github.com/VisualGuruz/emberjs-pageable).
